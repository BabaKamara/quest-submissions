QUESTS

1. Why did we add a Collection to this contract? List the two main reasons.

    If we have a ton of NFTs and want to store them ALL in the storage paths efficiently, then we just have to create a "Collection"

    Since my friends can not mint me an NFT in my /storage/ directly, thus I just have to create a "Collection".

2. What do you have to do if you have resources "nested" inside of another resource? ("Nested resources")
    
    I just have to declaee a destroy function that manually destroys the "nested resources" with the destroy keyword.

3. Brainstorm some extra things we may want to add to this contract. Think about what might be problematic with this contract and how we could fix it.

    Idea #1: Do we really want everyone to be able to mint an NFT? ðŸ¤”.

             I would say definitely "NO"

    Idea #2: If we want to read information about our NFTs inside our Collection, right now we have to take it out of the Collection to do so. Is this good?

             In my opinion "NO"
